## üíª Technologies Used

Efolio is built with a **Spring Boot** backend and a **React** frontend. These operate as two separate but connected applications.

- **React (Client):**  
  Runs in the user's web browser. It renders the UI (e.g., portfolio editor) and handles user interactions.

- **Spring Boot (Server):**  
  Runs on a server. It manages the database, enforces security rules, and contains all core business logic.
